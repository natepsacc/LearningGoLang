** Notes on learning goLang as they come**
I am nearly finished with Memory (Craik, Jacoby).  Meaning = Learning, digesting == defer meaning, knowing > recollecting. So silly notes with no real structure :).

All files in a dir with the same package declaration will compile together.  This means we can call functions from seperate files without importing them given they have the same package and location.
This means that seperate packages need seperate dir.  which would be imported respecting that uniq package name.

 -- just made that fetch a package from a sister file.  The dir name of the package does not need to match the package name, but the import is the dir, so bc you dont have the import X from Y pattern, not naming the dir after the package could be a little annoying.

The goRoutines / channels is pretty sick.  im excited to build simething heavy with that as they are pretty lw.

:= and <- are key combinations which will take a sec to get used to :)
